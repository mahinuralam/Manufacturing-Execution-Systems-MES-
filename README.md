# Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES) for Defect Detection

## Project Description

This project focuses on enhancing defect detection in manufacturing execution systems (MES). By leveraging advanced deep learning models and synthetic data generation, we were able to address challenges such as class imbalance and data limitations. The system achieves high accuracy in detecting defects within products during the manufacturing process, ensuring quality control and operational efficiency.

### Key Achievements:
- **98% Accuracy with Transformer-fused Multi-CNN Model**: Developed a Transformer-fused Multi-CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) model that achieved an impressive **98% accuracy** in detecting defects. This model surpasses existing defect detection models in terms of performance, making it highly effective in real-world manufacturing environments.

- **Synthetic Defect Image Generation with Stable Diffusion**: To overcome data limitations and mitigate class imbalance issues, we utilized **Stable Diffusion** to generate synthetic defect images. This approach not only enhanced the diversity of training data but also improved the robustness and generalization capabilities of the model.

- **Datasets Used**: The **MVtec Ad** and **MVtec Loco AD** datasets were used for training and evaluating the models. These datasets provided real-world images of defective and non-defective products, offering a comprehensive foundation for developing the defect detection system.
